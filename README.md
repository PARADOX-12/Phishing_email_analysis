# Phishing Email Analysis - Cybersecurity Internship Task 2

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains my analysis of a phishing email sample for the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship Task 2. The objective is to identify and document phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

## 🎯 Task Objectives
- Identify phishing characteristics in suspicious email samples
- Analyze email headers for authentication failures
- Document social engineering tactics used
- Demonstrate email threat analysis skills

## 📁 Repository Contents

### Files
- `phishing_sample.eml` - Sample phishing email for analysis
- `analysis_report.md` - Detailed technical analysis and findings
- `README.md` - This overview document
- `interview_prep.md` - Answers to common phishing-related interview questions

### Sample Email Details
- **Type:** Voice message phishing scam
- **Target:** Internal company communication impersonation
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (Critical authentication failures)

## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

| Finding | Risk Level | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| SPF Authentication Failure | CRITICAL | Sender IP not authorized by domain |
| Missing DKIM Signature | HIGH | No digital signature verification |
| DMARC Policy Violation | HIGH | Failed domain authentication |
| Suspicious Attachment | HIGH | Malicious file download attempt |
| Social Engineering | MEDIUM | Urgency tactics and impersonation |

## 🛠 Tools and Methods Used

### Analysis Tools
- **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer** - Header authentication analysis
- **Mailmodo Header Analyzer** - SPF/DKIM/DMARC verification
- **Manual Analysis** - Content and social engineering review

### Methodology
1. Email header extraction and analysis
2. Authentication protocol verification (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
3. Content analysis for social engineering indicators
4. Risk assessment and documentation

## 📊 Analysis Results

### Authentication Failures
- ❌ **SPF:** FAIL - Unauthorized sending IP (192.0.2.1)
- ❌ **DKIM:** NONE - Missing digital signature
- ❌ **DMARC:** FAIL - Policy violation detected

### Phishing Indicators
- ✅ Sender domain spoofing
- ✅ Suspicious attachment request
- ✅ Urgent/threatening language
- ✅ Grammar and spelling errors
- ✅ Generic impersonal content

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated
- Email security analysis
- Header authentication interpretation
- Threat detection and assessment
- Social engineering recognition
- Technical documentation
- Cybersecurity best practices
